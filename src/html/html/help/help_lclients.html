Using this feature user can see all the PCs on the LAN segment. Each PC is 
qualified to be either "dynamic" (PC obtained a lease from this router) or 
"static" (PC has a manually configured IP address).<br><br>
User can add a "static" IP address( belonging to the network segment of the router LAN IP address ).
Any existing static entry falling within dhcp server's range can be deleted and the IP address would be made available 
for future allocation.<br><br>
Once an IP address is allocated it shows up in the list of LAN clients as a 
"dynamic" entry. Any dynamic entry can be converted into static by using "reserve" checkbox.<br><br>
Note: Dynamic clients show up in the list only when DHCP server is running.

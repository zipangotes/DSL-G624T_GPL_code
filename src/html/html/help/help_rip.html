		Dynamic Routing uses RIP ( Routing Information Protocol) for exchanging routing 
		information with other routers in the network.<br><br>

		The user can set the following parameters:<br><br>

		Enable   : Enable/Disable RIP<br><br>
		Protocol : Choice of RIP version ( RIP v1/v2/Compatibility)<br><br>
		Enable Password: RIP version v2/Compatibility allows the user to provide simple 
		plaintext password based authentication to RIP packets.<br><br>
		Password : The 16 character long plaintext password.<br><br>
		Direction: Normally when RIP is enabled on a router it dynamically learns routes 
		on all it's configured interfaces. This parameter allows the user to select the interfaces 
		on which RIP is expected to learn and distribute routing information. This feature allows 
		the user to control how and which routes get distributed through the network e.g. prevent 
		routes to the private LAN networks from being sent over to the WAN side router.<br><br>
		On a per-interface basis the user can choose to<br><br>

		a) Both => Receive updates on the interface and also send it's routing table to other routers 
		    connected to that interface.<br><br>
		b) In =>  Receive routing updates from other routers connected to that interface but NOT send 
		    routing updates on that interface.<br><br>
		c) Out => Send routing updates but not receive updates on this interface from the other routers 
		    connected to that interface<br><br>
		d) None => Ignores this interface and not send or receive routing updates through this interface.<br><br>

                Note: If the modem has multiple WAN connections and is expected to learn routes from WAN side 
                      routers as well as route traffic between the WAN interfaces then NAT and Firewall services 
                      should be disabled on all the relevant WAN interfaces.<br><br>

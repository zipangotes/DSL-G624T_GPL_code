IP QoS services in the NSP is applicable to the output device (Egress side).
Meaning the IP QoS traffic shaping is associated with any transmitted traffic 
from the perspective of the NSP. Each output device has 3 priority queues 
associated with transmit data. The High priority queue has strict priority over
medium and low priority queues. The Medium and Low priority queues are serviced
on a Round Robin priority basis according to the configured weights (WRR), after
the High priority queue has been completely serviced.<br>
The "IP QoS" section under "Advanced section" allows you to setup IP QoS for a
connection.<br>
The "IP QoS" section has two sub-sections - <u>QoS Setup Page</u> and <u>Rule Setup Page.</u></font>

        <font size=1><b>QoS Setup Page</b><br>
The QoS setup page allows you to configure IP QoS for a connection, to view the 
configured QoS rules and to add/delete a QoS rule.<br>

<u>Choose a connection:</u> This field allows you choose a connection from the
list of available connections. For e.g. Choose a WAN connection to enable IP QoS
for the Upstream traffic of the Modem. On the other hand choose the LAN connection
(Ethernet and USB Bridged) for the downstream traffic.<br>

<u>Low/Medium priority weights:</u> These 2 fields will allow you to select the
weights of the Medium and Low priority queues in increments of 10 percent, so 
that that the sum of the weights of these 2 queues is equal to 100 percent.<br>

<u>Enable IP QoS:</u> This field allows you to enable/disable IP QoS for the
chosen connection.<br>

<u>Trusted Mode:</u> The NSP has two primary modes of operation with regard
to queue traffic prioritization - Trusted and Un-trusted. This field allows you
to choose the mode - Trusted (checked) and Un-trusted (Unchecked).<br>
In "Trusted mode" all the rules will be applied first, regardless of the setting
of the TOS bits. After the rules have been exhausted the existing TOS bit settings 
will be honored. The "Un-trusted" mode will match first against all rules as in 
"Trusted" mode. The difference is that if there is no match then a default rule
will be used. The default rule will have an associated queuing priority - Low.<br>

<u>Rules section:</u> This section displays a list of configured rules, allows
you to add a new rule and allows you to delete an existing rule.<br>
Each rule is a Matching criteria that identifies an Application traffic to be
transmitted by the NSP using one of the 3 Priority Queues - High, Medium and Low.<br><br>

<u>Note:</u> If IP QoS is enabled and no rules are defined, a Default Rule is added 
which is hidden. The Default Rule puts all the Traffic to be transmitted in the
<u>Low Priority Queue</u>.

        <font size=1><b>Rule Setup Page</b><br>
This page is invoked when you click on the "Add" button of "QoS Setup Page". 
This page allows you add a Rule or Matching criteria that identifies an Application
traffic. The Application traffic can be identified by Rule Name, Source/Destination 
IP Address and Netmask, Source/Destination Port range, Protocol and Traffic Priority.<br>

The Traffic Priority field corresponds to the Priority Queue (High/Medium/Low) for
for this traffic. The possible options for Protocol are - ANY, ICMP, TCP and UDP. 
Wildcard(*) entries are allowed for IP Address/Netmask and Port range fields.<br>

The additional TOS marking field allows you to assign a TOS value to this traffic.
The values for the TOS marking can be - No Change, Normal Service, Minimize
monetary cost, Maximize reliability, Maximize throughput and Minimize delay.

0.38 - Sat Oct 11 2003 16:28:13 +0800

- Default hostkey path changed to /etc/dropbear/dropbear_{rsa,dss}_host_key
  rather than /etc/dropbear_{rsa,dss}_host_key

- Added SMALL and MULTI text files which have info on compiling for multiple
  binaries or small binaries

- Allow for commandline definition of some options.h settings
  (without warnings)

- Be more careful handling EINTR

- More fixes for channel closing

- Added multi-binary support

- Improved logging of IPs, now get logged in all cases

- Don't chew cpu when waiting for version identification string, also
  make sure that we kick off people if they don't auth within 5 minutes.

- Various small fixes, warnings etc

- Display MOTD if requested - suggested by
  Trent Lloyd <lathiat at sixlabs.org> and
  Zach White <zwhite at darkstar.frop.org>

- sftp support works (relies on OpenSSH sftp binary or similar)

- Added --disable-shadow option (requested by the floppyfw guys)

0.37 - Wed Sept 24 2003 19:42:12 +0800

- Various portability fixes, fixes for Solaris 9, Tru64 5.1, Mac OS X 10.2,
  AIX, BSDs

- Updated LibTomMath to 0.27 and LibTomCrypt to 0.90

- Renamed util.{c,h} to dbutil.{c,h} to avoid conflicts with system util.h

- Added some small changes so it'll work with AIX (plus Linux Affinity).
  Thanks to Shig for them.

- Improved the closing messages, so a clean exit is "Exited normally"

- Added some more robust integer/size checking in buffer.c as a backstop for
  integer overflows

- X11 forwarding fixed for OSX, path for xauth changed to /usr/X11R6/bin/xauth

- Channel code handles closing more nicely, doesn't sit waiting for an extra
  keystroke on BSD/OSX platforms, and data is flushed fully before closing
  child processes (thanks to 
  Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn <cristian.ionescu-idbohrn at axis.com> for
  pointing that out).

- Changed "DISABLE_TCPFWD" to "ENABLE_TCPFWD" (and for x11/auth) so
  "disable DISABLE_TCPWD" isn't so confusing.

- Fix authorized_keys handling (don't crash on too-long keys, and
  use fgetc not getc to avoid strange macro-related issues), thanks to
  Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn <cristian.ionescu-idbohrn at axis.com> 
  and Steve Rodgers <hwstar at cox.net> for reporting and testing.

- Fixes to the README with regard to uClibc systems, thanks to 
  Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn <cristian.ionescu-idbohrn at axis.com>,
  as well as general improvements to documentation (split README/INSTALL)

- Fixed up some compilation problems with dropbearconvert/dropbearkey if
  DSS or RSA were disabled, reported by Patrik Karlsson <patrik at cqure.net>

- Fix double-free bug for hostkeys, reported by
  Vincent Sanders <vince at kyllikki.org>

- Fix up missing \ns from dropbearconvert help message,
  thanks to Mordy Ovits <movits at bloomberg.com> for the patch

0.36 - Tue August 19 2003 12:16:23 +0800

- Fix uninitialised temporary variable in DSS signing code
  (thanks to Matthew Franz <mdfranz at io.com> for reporting, and the authors
  of Valgrind for making it easy to track down)
- Fix remote version-string parsing error
  (thanks to Bernard Blackham <bernard at blackham.com.au> for noticing)
- Improved host-algorithm-matching algorithm in algo.c
- Decreased MAX_STRING_LEN to a more realistic value
- Fix incorrect version (0.34) in this CHANGES file for the previous release.

0.35 - Sun August 17 2003 05:37:47 +0800

  (thanks to Joel Eriksson <je at bitnux.com>)

0.34 - Fri August 15 2003 15:10:00 +0800

- Made syslog optional, both at compile time and as a compile option
  (suggested by Laurent Bercot <ska at skarnet.org>)
- Fixup for bad base64 parsing in authorized_keys
  (noticed by Davyd Madeley <davyd at zdlcomputing.com>)
- Added initial tcp forwarding code, only -L (local) at this stage
- Improved "make install" with DESTDIR and changing ownership seperately,
  don't check for setpgrp on Linux for crosscompiling.
  (from Erik Andersen <andersen at codepoet.org>)
- More commenting, fix minor compile warnings, make return values more
  consistent etc
- Various signedness fixes
- Can listen on multiple ports
- added option to disable openpty with configure script,
  (from K.-P. Kirchdörfer <kapeka at epost.de>)
- Various cleanups to bignum code
  (thanks to Tom St Denis <tomstdenis at iahu.ca>)
- Fix compile error when disabling RSA
  (from Marc Kleine-Budde <kleine-budde at gmx.de>)
- Other cleanups, splitting large functions for packet and kex handling etc

0.33 - Sun June 22 2003 22:24:12 +0800

- Fixed some invalid assertions in the channel code, fixing the server dying
  when forwarding X11 connections.
- Add dropbearconvert to convert to/from OpenSSH host keys and Dropbear keys
- RSA keys now keep p and q parameters for compatibility -- old Dropbear keys
  still work, but can't be converted to OpenSSH etc.
- Debian packaging directory added, thanks to 
  Grahame (grahame at angrygoats.net)
- 'install' target added to the makefile
- general tidying, improve consistency of functions etc
- If RSA or DSS hostkeys don't exist, that algorithm won't be used.
- Improved RSA and DSS key generation, more efficient and fixed some minor bugs
  (thanks to Tom St Denis for the advice)
- Merged new versions of LibTomCrypt (0.86) and LibTomMath (0.21)

0.32 - Sat May 24 2003 12:44:11 +0800

- Don't compile unused code from libtomcrypt (test vectors etc)
- Updated to libtommath 0.17 and libtomcrypt 0.83. New libtommath results
  in smaller binary size, due to not linking unrequired code
- X11 forwarding added
- Agent forwarding added (for OpenSSH.com ssh client/agent)
- Fix incorrect buffer freeing when banners are used
- Hostname resolution works
- Various minor bugfixes/code size improvements etc

0.31 - Fri May 9 2003 17:57:16 +0800

- Improved syslog messages - IP logging etc
- Strip control characters from log messages (specified username currently)
- Login recording (utmp/wtmp) support, so last/w/who work - taken from OpenSSH
- Shell is started as a proper login shell, so /etc/profile etc is sourced
- Ptys work on Solaris (2.8 x86 tested) now
- Fixed bug in specifying the rsa hostkey
- Fixed bug in compression code, could trigger if compression resulted in
  larger output than input (uncommon but possible).

0.30 - Thu Apr 17 2003 18:46:15 +0800

- SECURITY: buffer.c had bad checking for buffer increment length - fixed
- channel code now closes properly on EOF - scp processes don't hang around
- syslog support added - improved auth/login/failure messages
- general code tidying, made return codes more consistent
- Makefile fixed for dependencies and makes libtomcrypt as well
- Implemented sending SSH_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED :)

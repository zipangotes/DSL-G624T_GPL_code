<h1>NAND FLASH</h1>

<h2>NAND vs. NOR</h2>

<p>Beside the different silicon cell design, the most important difference between NAND and NOR Flash is the bus interface. NOR Flash is connected to a address / data bus direct like other
memory devices as SRAM etc. NAND Flash uses a multiplexed I/O Interface with some additional control pins. NAND flash is a sequential access device appropriate for mass storage applications,
while NOR flash is a random access device appropriate for code storage application.NOR Flash can be used for code storage and code execution. Code stored on NAND Flash
can't be executed frome there. It must be loaded into RAM memory and executed from there.</p>

<p>As NAND Flash is cheaper than NOR Flash and has a very slim interface it was selected as the optimum solution
 for large nonvolatile storage applications such as solid state file storage, digital audio/voice recorder,
 digital still camera and portable applications requiring non-volatility.</p>

                       
<hr>
<h2>NAND Types</h2>

<p>There are various types of NAND Flash available.

Bare NAND chips, SmartMediaCards, DiskOnChip.</p>

<p>SmartMediaCards are bare NAND chips covered by thin plastic. They are very common in
digital cameras and MP3 players. The card itself contains nothing smart at all. It gets
smart by software.</p>

<p>DiskOnChip is NAND Flash with additional glue logic as a drop in replacement for NOR Flash chips.
The glue logic provides direct memory access to a small address window, which contains a boot
loader stub, which loads the real boot code from the NAND device.</p>


<hr>
<h2>NAND technical view</h2>

<p>The memory is arranged as a array of pages. A page consists of 256 / 512 Byte data and 8 / 16 Byte spare (out of band) area.
The spare area is used to store ECC (error correction code), bad block information and filesystem dependend data.
n pages build one block.
The read / write access to data is on a per page basis. Erase is done on a per block basis.
The commands to read / write / erase the chip is given by writing to the chip with the
Command Latch Enable pin high. Address is given by writing with the Address Latch Enable pin high.
</p>

<p>There are only a few lines neccecary to access up to 256 MB of Flashmemory.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>I/O 0-7  </td>
    <td>Data Inputs/Outputs  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/CE  </td>
    <td>Chip Enable  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CLE  </td>
    <td>Command Latch Enable  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ALE  </td>
    <td>Address Latch Enable  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/RE  </td>
    <td>Read Enable  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/WE  </td>
    <td>Write Enable  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/WP  </td>
    <td>Write Protect  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/SE  </td>
    <td>Spare area Enable  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>R/B  </td>
    <td>Ready / Busy Output  </td>
  </tr>
</table><br><br>

<p>As it is recommended to use the spare area, the /SE (Spare area Enable) pin should be tied to GND.
 /CE, CLE and ALE should be GPIO pins or latched signals. It's possible to use address lines for ALE and CLE,
 but you have to take care about the timing restrictions of the chip ! /RE and /WE can be tied to the corresponding lines of the CPU.
 I/O 0-7 are connected to the databus D0-D7. The /WP pin can be used for write protection or connected to VCC to enable writes unconditionally.
 As NAND flash uses a command driven programming and erasing, an accidential write or erase is not likely to happen.
 The Ready / Busy output is not neccecary for operation, but it can be tied to a GPIO or an interrupt line.

<h2>Filesystems supporting NAND</h2>

<p>One major problem for using NAND Flash is, that you cannot write as often as you want to a page.
The consecutive writes to a page, before erasing it again, are restricted to 1-3 writes, depending on the manufacturers specifications.
This applies similar to the spare area. This makes it neccecary for the filesystem to handle a writebuffer,
which contains data, that is less than a page</p>
<p>At the moment there are only a few filesystems, which support NAND</p>

<ul>
  <li>JFFS2 for bare NAND Flash and SmartMediaCards </li>
  <li>NTFL for DiskOnChip devices </li>
  <li>TRUEFFS from M-Systems for DiskOnChip devices</li>
  <li>SmartMedia DOS-FAT as defined by the SSFDC Forum</li>
</ul>

<p>JFFS2 and NTFL are Open Source, while TRUEFFS is a proprietary solution. SmartMedia DOS-Fat is a specification from
SSFDC forum. It is somewhat open under a non disclosure agreement with Toshiba, who owns all rights on this specifications.
NTFL is designed for the usage of DiskOnChip devices. JFFS2 supports raw NAND chips and SmartMediaCards at the moment. A JFFS2 support for
DiskOnChip devices, based on the NAND code, is planned.
There are some other Open Source projects for NAND filesystem support, but there's no other working solution than JFFS2 at the moment of this writing.
</p>
<p>There is currently no support for the wide spread SmartMedia DOS-FAT filesystem, mainly because it's not a reliable filesystem
for industrial usage. It's ok for multimedia applications. The hardware support layer is designed to support a implementation of SmartMedia
DOS-FAT, but nobody has made an attempt to implement it really. There are a couple of SmartMedia Card adaptors 
for USB, PCMCIA, FireWire ... with Linux drivers available, which support the SmartMedia DOS-FAT. 
</p>

<p>JFFS2 includes bad block management, wear leveling, error correction and provides a reliable filesystem on top of NAND Flash</p>

<h2>HOWTO implement NAND support</h2>

<h3>Where can you get the code ?</h3>
<p>The changes to JFFS2 and the underlying NAND code are not in the kernel code at the moment. The latest code is available from
<a href=http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org>CVS and daily snapshots</a></p>

<p>There are four layers of software</p>
<ol>
  <li>JFFS2: filesystem driver</li>
  <li>MTD: Memory Technology Devices driver</li>
  <li>NAND: generic NAND driver  </li>
  <li>Hardware specific driver  </li>
</ol>
<p>
The MTD driver just provides a mount point for JFFS2. The generic NAND driver provides
all functions, which are neccecary to identify, read, write and erase NAND Flash. The hardware
dependend functions are provided by the hardware driver.
</p>

<h3>Hardware driver</h3>

<p>To implement it on your hardware, you will have to write a new hardware driver. Use one of the existing
hardware drivers and modify it to fit your hardware. The most important things are:
</p>

<p>
<b>void yourboard_hwcontrol(int cmd)</b><br>
{<br>
	switch(cmd){<br>
	case NAND_CTL_SETCLE: <i>Hardware specific code to set CLE line to 1;</i> break;<br>
	case NAND_CTL_CLRCLE: <i>Hardware specific code to set CLE line to 0;</i> break;<br>
	case NAND_CTL_SETALE: <i>Hardware specific code to set ALE line to 1;</i> break;<br>
	case NAND_CTL_CLRALE: <i>Hardware specific code to set ALE line to 0;</i> break;<br>
	case NAND_CTL_SETNCE: <i>Hardware specific code to set CE line to 0;</i> break;<br>
	case NAND_CTL_CLRNCE: <i>Hardware specific code to set CE line to 1;</i> break;<br>
	}<br>
}<br>
This functions is used to access the control pins of the chip. The function is called from
the generic nand driver.
</p>
<p>
<b>int yourboard_device_ready(void)</b><br>
{<br>
	return <i>The state of the ready/busy pin of the chip;</i><br>
}<br>
If your hardware interface does not have access to the ready busy pin, you can delete this
function and set the function pointer this->dev_ready to NULL.
</p>

<p>
<b>int __init yourboard_init (void)</b><br>
{<br>
        SNIP<br>
	/* Allocate memory for MTD device structure and private data */<br>
	yourboard_mtd = kmalloc (sizeof(struct mtd_info) + sizeof (struct nand_chip),GFP_KERNEL);<br>
        SNIP<br>
	/* map physical adress */<br>
	yourboard_fio_base=(unsigned long)ioremap(yourboard_fio_pbase,SZ_1K);<br>
        SNIP<br>
	/* Set address of NAND IO lines */<br>
	this->IO_ADDR_R = yourboard_fio_base; <i>The address to read from the chip </i><br>
	this->IO_ADDR_W = yourboard_fio_base; <i>The address to write to the chip </i><br>
	this->hwcontrol = yourboard_hwcontrol;<i>Your function for accessing the controllines</i><br>
	this->dev_ready = yourboard_device_ready; <i>Your function for accessing the ready/busy line or NULL, if you don't have one</i><br>
	this->chip_delay = 20;<i>The delay time (µs), after writing a command to the chip, according to datasheet</i><br>
        SNIP<br>
}<br>
If you have a different access scheme to the chip for writing commands, due to your hardware, you can supply a own
command write function by setting this->cmdfunc. The same applies for a own wait function, which could utilize an interrupt
driven by the ready/busy pin. In this case set this->waitfunc to your own function. This must be done before calling nand_scan.
<p>

<h3>Supported chips</h3>
<p>Most NAND chips actually available from 2 to 128MB should be supported by the current code. If you have a chip, which is not supported,
it can easily be added by extending the chiplist in include/linux/mtd/nand_ids.h
</p>

<h3>Config settings</h3>
<p>The following config switches should be set<br>
CONFIG_MTD=y<br>
CONFIG_MTD_PARTITIONS=y --- if you want to use partitions<br>
CONFIG_MTD_CHAR=y<br>
CONFIG_MTD_BLOCK=y<br>
CONFIG_MTD_NAND=y<br>
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_ECC=y<br>
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_ECC_JFFS2=y<br>
CONFIG_MTD_NAND_YOURBOARD=y</p>

<p>For JFFS2 usage set<br>
CONFIG_JFFS2_FS=y<br>
CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_DEBUG=0<br>
CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_NAND=y</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4>Can I boot from NAND Flash?</h4>
<p>Not from a bare NAND chip. You need a glue logic around, which gives you memory access to the
chip on bootup, like the DiskOnChip devices do. This will be a quite complex CPLD. An alternative
is to use a small e.g. 1MB NOR Flash, which contains the boot code and maybe a compressed kernel
image. Then you can use JFFS2 on NAND as your root filesystem</p>
<h4>Is there support for 16/32bit wide NAND Flash ?</h4>
<p>No. The generic NAND driver supports 8 bit wide NAND Flash only. 16 or 32 bit NAND Flash can
be built by using 2 or 4 chips and connect them to D0-7, D8-D15, D16-D23 and D24-D31 on the data bus.
You can tie all corresponding control signals together. But you have to build a new nand16 or nand32 driver,
which can be derived from the existing nand.c. Be aware, that the writebuffer size is 2 or 4 times as big as
on 8 bit NAND. This mean's, if you flush the buffer to ensure, that your data are on disk, you may waste much
more memory space than on 8 bit NAND. Another point is bad block handling. When a block on 1 chip is bad, the
corresponding blocks on the other chips are lost too, as you present them as one big block to the filesystem
driver. The JFFS2 code, which handles the writebuffer and the out of band (spare) area of NAND doesn't support
16 / 32 bit neither.
<h4>How is ensured, that data is written to flash ?</h4>
<p>As we have to handle a writebuffer for writing only full pages to the chips, there could be a loss of
data, when the writebuffer is not flushed before power down. There are some mechanisms to ensure,
that the writebuffer is flushed. You can force the flush of the writebuffer by using fsync() or sync()
in your application. JFFS2 has a timed flush of the write buffer, which forces the flush of the buffer to flash,
if there are no writes to the filesystem for more than 2 seconds. When you unmount the filesystem the buffer
is flushed too.</p>
<h4>Can I copy a JFFS2 Image to NAND</h4>
<p>Yes, as long as your chip does not contain bad blocks. Make sure, that the erasesize you set to mkfs.jffs2
is the same as the erasesize of your chip</p>
